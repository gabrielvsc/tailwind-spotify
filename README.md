## Description
This is a personal project where I have adapted an idea from Rocketseat to study and practice using NextJS, TailwindCSS and React components. The original idea served as a foundation, but I have made modifications and additions to suit my learning objectives.

The project aims to explore the capabilities of TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, in combination with React components. By building various components and layouts, I will gain hands-on experience with both technologies and enhance my understanding of their integration.
